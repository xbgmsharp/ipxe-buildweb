iPXE Prebuilt binary web interface
=====

## Why
A Prebuilt binary web interface. Many users would prefer to be able to download prebuilt binary versions of iPXE, rather than building it from source.

## What
A web-based user interface that provide a way for the user to select any relevant iPXE build options, specify any embedded script, etc, and then construct and download the appropriate file.

## Where
A Hosted build server using this project is made available by a 3rd-Party @ [rom-o-matic.dev](https://rom-o-matic.dev/). This project has no affiliation with the 3rd party hosting this build server and encourages indivduals to build their own binaries.

## How
The user interface, is using HTML, CSS as well as Javascript (jQuery) and a suitable server-side language (such as Perl and PHP).
All GUI options (git version/nics list/compile options) are generated dynamicaly using PHP.
The build.fcgi script is written in Perl and was wrote by Michael Brown.

## Using Official DockerHub image [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/xbgmsharp/ipxe-buildweb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/xbgmsharp/ipxe-buildweb)

[![dockeri.co](https://dockeri.co/image/xbgmsharp/ipxe-buildweb)](https://hub.docker.com/r/xbgmsharp/ipxe-buildweb)

* Supported tags:

`latest` - Latest ([Dockerfile](https://github.com/xbgmsharp/ipxe-buildweb/blob/master/Dockerfile))

> The docker image is updated daily by a cron job from ([Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/xbgmsharp/ipxe-buildweb)).

* Supported architectures: x86-64

* Run ipxe-buildweb

After a successful [Docker installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) you just need to execute the following command in the shell:

```bash
docker pull xbgmsharp/ipxe-buildweb
docker run  -d \
	--publish 8080:80 \
	--publish 22:22 \
	--name ipxe-buildweb \
	xbgmsharp/ipxe-buildweb
```

## Test using Docker

* Install Docker
[Install documentation of Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

The Docker deb package are valid for Ubuntu and Debian.

```bash
$ wget http://get.docker.io/ -O - | sh
```

* Build the images

The following command build the build directly from the github repository.

The build process might take some time a while as it download the origin Ubuntu LTS 14.04 docker image.
```bash
$ docker build --rm=true --no-cache=true -t xbgmsharp/ipxe-buildweb github.com/xbgmsharp/ipxe-buildweb.git
```

Alternatively, you can build the image localy after cloning the repository.
```bash
$ docker build --rm=true --no-cache=true -t xbgmsharp/ipxe-buildweb .
```

* Run the container

Run as a detach container
```bash
$ docker run -d -p 22:22 -p 8080:80 -t xbgmsharp/ipxe-buildweb
```

Or run the container with an attach shell
```
$ docker run -i --rm -p 22:22 -p 8080:80 -t xbgmsharp/ipxe-buildweb /bin/bash
```

* Check the IP

```bash
$ docker ps -a
$ docker inspect CONTAINER_ID | grep IPA
```

Or both command in one
```bash
$ docker ps -a | grep ipxe-buildweb | awk '{print $1}' | xargs docker inspect | grep IPAddress
```

Or all in one with the ssh connection
```bash
$ ssh $(docker ps -a | grep ipxe-buildweb | awk '{print $1}' | xargs docker inspect | grep IPAddress | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d '"' | tr -d ',' )
```

* Login in the container via SSH

User is root and password is admin.

```bash
$ ssh root@172.17.0.x
```

* Review logs

```bash
$ docker logs CONTAINER_ID
```

* Enjoy!
